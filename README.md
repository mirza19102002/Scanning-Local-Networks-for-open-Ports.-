# Scanning-Local-Networks-for-open-Ports.-
Using Nmap to Scan the local Network for checking for the Open Ports
Step 1 - Using Nmap for scanning the local network for Open Ports.
Step 2 - Type the target Ip Address and the Use the Command  (nmap -T4 -A -v 192.168.192.1/5),(nmap -F 192.168.192.1/5),(nmap -sU 192.168.192.1/5), (nmap -p- 192.168.192.1/5) for most common Open Ports.

Step 3 - Check the Ports and Hosts where i found some TCP Open Ports.

Step 4 - Captured the Open Ports and IP address Found.

Potential Risks from Open Ports : Open ports on a network or device can create security vulnerabilities, potentially allowing unauthorized access and posing risks like data breaches, malware distribution, and denial-of-service attacks. These risks arise because open ports act as entry points, and attackers can exploit misconfigured services or vulnerabilities on these ports to compromise systems.
